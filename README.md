# Digitle-Proj
Goal: To create and implement on the web a digit based guessing game. The game will consist of a random non repeating 5 digit
number of which the user has 5 attempts to guess accurately. Upon each guess the user will be given a small amount of information to nudge them towards the correct guess. 

When a user sends a guess along, the color of each digits's box changes:
- If it turns green, that digit is in the correct position
- If it turns orange, the digit is in the wrong position
- If the box turns grey, the digit is incorrect

Note that the reasoning distance is given and not directionality is to ensure that while the game will have an element of reasoning, it is still slightly luck based!
